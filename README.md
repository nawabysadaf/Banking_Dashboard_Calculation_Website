# Banking Customer's Dashboard Calculation Website

## 📌 Project Description

Welcome to **Banking System Website**, a modern and interactive web application developed to practice and strengthen my skills in **HTML, SASS, and advanced JavaScript.** Through this project, I focused on applying advanced front-end concepts such as **JavaScript logic implementation, complex calculations, DOM manipulation, event handling, modular coding, and responsive design using SASS.**

The website simulates a digital banking system where users can sign in to their accounts and view a complete banking interface that displays various user operations and data interactions. All features, including account handling and calculations, are built entirely using JavaScript to create a dynamic and realistic experience.

Please note that this project is strictly for educational and practice purposes only. The original concept and design belong to the course creator, and I do not claim ownership of them. I built this project while following an online JavaScript course to apply, experiment with, and deepen my understanding of advanced front-end development.

Feel free to explore the code for learning or inspiration. **Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!**
